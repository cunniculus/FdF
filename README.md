# FdF

FdF stands for "Fil de Fer", french for Wireframe Model. This cool project is all about representing a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines - a.k.a. wires.

I am using a a small library, called MiniLibX, designed by 42 School in Paris in order to introduce us to the basic tools for openning a window, creating images and dealing with keyboard and mouse events. 

The main idea is to read a file with 3D coordinates and represent a model of the surface in ISOMETRIC PROJECTION. 

I shall try to add some cool transformations, like zoom in ou out, translate, rotate, another couple of projections, and hopefully more.

Definitely the most challenging project so far. And certainly the most fun!!

It is a work in progress... ;)
